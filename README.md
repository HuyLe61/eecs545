# EECS 545: Machine Learning (Winter 2026)

This repository contains my coursework for **EECS 545: Machine Learning** at the University of Michigan, Winter 2026.

## Course Description

The goal of machine learning is to develop computer algorithms that can learn from data or past experience to predict well on the new unseen data. In the past few decades, machine learning has become a powerful tool in artificial intelligence and data mining, and it has made major impacts in many real-world applications.

This course provides a graduate-level introduction to machine learning, covering foundations, mathematical derivation and implementation of algorithms, and their applications. Topics include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, learning theory, probabilistic models, and reinforcement learning. The course also covers recent research topics such as deep learning, with emphasis on practical applications to computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and robot perception and control.
